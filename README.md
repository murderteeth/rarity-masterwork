### Wtf is a masterwork component?
The d20 "masterwork component" is a proxy for whatever it is that differentiates a common item from its masterwork counterpart. For a sword, that could mean strong metals and fine woods.


## Creating Masterwork Items (d20)
> You can make a masterwork itemâ€”a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.
